// Type inference (grammar: An inference is an idea or conclusion that's drawn from evidence and reasoning)
// understanding type inference
// Type annotations

let a: number;
let b = 65;  // This is called inference. automatically sets the datatype, by observing the data
let c = "36";

// Annoations simply means ki "what" like for eg
let x: number | string | boolean;
x = 89;
x = "69";
x = true;

// Above type annotation was on variable. Below is annotation on functions
function abcd(a: number, b: string):void{

};
